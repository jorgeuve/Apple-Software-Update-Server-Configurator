Apple-Software-Update-Server-Configurator
=========================================

A utility to configure macintosh computers to use another catalog repository for updates rather than the one provider by Apple

Very important for big apple computer places to avoid spending internet data flow and to take control of what updates generated by apple should be applied in the computers of the company and which are not. 

This application allows the user to easily modify their update center thinking about when they are not in the company or if they have abandoned it, giving the user a simple way to choose if he wants to continue receiving updates.
